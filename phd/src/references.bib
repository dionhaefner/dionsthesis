  abstract  = {State-of-the-art computer vision systems are trained to predict a fixed set of predetermined object categories. This restricted form of supervision limits their generality and usability since additional labeled data is needed to specify any other visual concept. Learning directly from raw text about images is a promising alternative which leverages a much broader source of supervision. We demonstrate that the simple pre-training task of predicting which caption goes with which image is an efficient and scalable way to learn SOTA image representations from scratch on a dataset of 400 million (image, text) pairs collected from the internet. After pre-training, natural language is used to reference learned visual concepts (or describe new ones) enabling zero-shot transfer of the model to downstream tasks. We study the performance of this approach by benchmarking on over 30 different existing computer vision datasets, spanning tasks such as OCR, action recognition in videos, geo-localization, and many types of fine-grained object classification. The model transfers non-trivially to most tasks and is often competitive with a fully supervised baseline without the need for any dataset specific training. For instance, we match the accuracy of the original ResNet-50 on ImageNet zero-shot without needing to use any of the 1.28 million training examples it was trained on.},

To explore the effects of nonlinearities, these are generalized to second-order waves, utilizing quasi-deterministic results on the expected shape of large waves. The efficacy of Gram–Charlier models in describing the effects of third-order nonlinearities on the distributions of wave heights, crests and troughs are examined in detail. All models and a fifth-order Stokes–Rayleigh type model recently proposed are compared with linear and nonlinear waves simulated from the JONSWAP spectrum representative of long-crested extreme seas, and also with oceanic data gathered in the North Sea. Uncertainties arising from the variability of probability estimates derived from sample populations of limited size are considered. Ultimately, the comparisons show that nonlinearities do not have any discernable effect on the crest-to-trough heights of oceanic waves. Most of the linear models considered yield similar and reasonable predictions of the observed data trends. Gram–Charlier type distributions seem neither effective nor particularly useful in describing the statistics of large wave heights or crests under oceanic conditions. However, they do surprisingly well in predicting unusually large wave heights and crests observed in some 2D wave-flume experiments and 3D numerical simulations of long-crested narrow-band random waves.},

The formulation and solution of the governing boundary value problem for small amplitude waves are developed and the kinematic and pressure fields for short and long waves are explored. The transformation of waves due to variations in depth and their interactions with structures are derived. Wavemaker theories and the statistics of ocean waves are reviewed. The application of the water particle motions and pressure fields are applied to the calculation of wave forces on small and large objects. Extension of the linear theory results to several nonlinear wave properties is presented. Each chapter concludes with a set of homework problems exercising and sometimes extending the material presented in the chapter. An appendix provides a description of nine experiments which can be performed, with little additional equipment, in most wave tank facilities.},

They may occur on the surface of a relatively calm sea and not reach very high amplitudes, but still be fatal for ships and crew due to their unexpectedness and abnormal features. Seamen are known to be unsurpassed authors of exciting and horrifying stories about the sea and sea waves. This could explain why, despite the increasing number of documented cases, that sailors’ observations of “walls of - ter” have been considered ctitious for a while. These stories are now addressed again due to the amount of doubtless evidence of the existence of the phenomenon, but still without suf cient information to - able interested researchers and engineers to completely understand it.

While such wave fields are easily achieved in laboratories, there appears to be lacking evidence that known occurrences of rogue waves in the ocean (e.g. Draupner “New Year” wave, Andrea wave) or ship accidents that could have been provoked by rogue waves (e.g. the Prestige accident) actually happened in sea states favorable for the modulational instability to have played an important role. The absence of modulational instability does not mean that nonlinear interactions are unimportant. Here we point out recent results that suggest large deviations from Gaussian statistics can happen due to nonlinearity in the absence of modulational instability, the key ingredient seems to be that the wave field is brought into a state of non-equilibrium.},

Compared to previous studies a more extensive set of crossing sea states are investigated, both with respect to spectral shape of the individual wave systems and with respect to the crossing angle and separation in peak frequency of the two wave systems. It is shown that, because of the effects described by Piterbarg, for a linear sea state the expected maximum crest elevation over a given surface area depends on the crossing angle so that the expected maximum crest elevation is largest when two wave systems propagate with a crossing angle close to 90°. It is further shown by nonlinear phase-resolving numerical simulations that nonlinear effects have an opposite effect, such that maximum sea surface kurtosis is expected for relatively large and small crossing angles, with a minimum around 90°, and that the expected maximum crest height is almost independent of the crossing angle. The numerical results are accompanied by analysis of the modulational instability of two crossing Stokes waves, which is studied using the Zakharov equation so that, different from previous studies, results are valid for arbitrary-bandwidth perturbations. It is shown that there is a positive correlation between the value of kurtosis in the numerical simulations and the maximum unstable growth rate of two crossing Stokes waves, even for realistic broadband crossing sea states.},

The 25.6 m high Draupner wave, observed in a sea state with a significant wave height of 12 m, was one of the first confirmed field measurements of a freak wave. The physical mechanisms that give rise to freak waves such as the Draupner wave are still contentious. Through physical experiments carried out in a circular wave tank, we attempt to recreate the freak wave measured at the Draupner platform and gain an understanding of the directional conditions capable of supporting such a large and steep wave. Herein, we recreate the full scaled crest amplitude and profile of the Draupner wave, including bound set-up. We find that the onset and type of wave breaking play a significant role and differ significantly for crossing and non-crossing waves. Crucially, breaking becomes less crest-amplitude limiting for sufficiently large crossing angles and involves the formation of near-vertical jets. In our experiments, we were only able to reproduce the scaled crest and total wave height of the wave measured at the Draupner platform for conditions where two wave systems cross at a large angle.},

  abstract  = {The energy transfer due to weak nonlinear interactions in random wave fields is reinterpreted in terms of a hypothetical ensemble of interacting particles, antiparticles, and virtual particles. In the particle picture, the interactions can be conveniently described by Feynman diagrams, which may be regarded either as branch diagrams of the perturbation expansion or as collision diagrams. The derivation of the transfer expressions can then be reduced to a few general rules for the construction of the diagrams and the associated collision cross sections. The representation follows closely the standard treatment of nonlinear lattice vibrations, but the particle picture differs from the usual phonon interpretation of lattice waves. It has the unrealistic property that the energies and number densities of antiparticles are negative. This is offset by simpler interaction rules and a closer correspondence between the perturbation graphs and collision diagrams. The method is illustrated for scattering processes in the oceanic wave guide involving surface and internal gravity waves, horizontal currents (turbulence), seismic waves, and bottom irregularities.},

  abstract = {Accurate models of the world are built upon notions of its underlying symmetries. In physics, these symmetries correspond to conservation laws, such as for energy and momentum. Yet even though neural network models see increasing use in the physical sciences, they struggle to learn these symmetries. In this paper, we propose Lagrangian Neural Networks (LNNs), which can parameterize arbitrary Lagrangians using neural networks. In contrast to models that learn Hamiltonians, LNNs do not require canonical coordinates, and thus perform well in situations where canonical momenta are unknown or difﬁcult to compute. Unlike previous approaches, our method does not restrict the functional form of learned energies and will produce energy-conserving models for a variety of tasks. We test our approach on a double pendulum and a relativistic particle, demonstrating energy conservation where a baseline approach incurs dissipation and modeling relativity without canonical coordinates where a Hamiltonian approach fails. Finally, we show how this model can be applied to graphs and continuous systems using a Lagrangian Graph Network, and demonstrate it on the 1D wave equation.},

The technique works as follows: we first encourage sparse latent representations when we train a GNN in a supervised setting, then we apply symbolic regression to components of the learned model to extract explicit physical relations. We find the correct known equations, including force laws and Hamiltonians, can be extracted from the neural network. We then apply our method to a non-trivial cosmology example-a detailed dark matter simulation-and discover a new analytic formula which can predict the concentration of dark matter from the mass distribution of nearby cosmic structures. The symbolic expressions extracted from the GNN using our technique also generalized to out-of-distribution data better than the GNN itself. Our approach offers alternative directions for interpreting neural networks and discovering novel physical principles from the representations they learn.},

We present the "Nine Motifs of Simulation Intelligence", a roadmap for the development and integration of the essential algorithms necessary for a merger of scientific computing, scientific simulation, and artificial intelligence. We call this merger simulation intelligence (SI), for short. We argue the motifs of simulation intelligence are interconnected and interdependent, much like the components within the layers of an operating system. Using this metaphor, we explore the nature of each layer of the simulation intelligence operating system stack (SI-stack) and the motifs therein: (1) Multi-physics and multi-scale modeling; (2) Surrogate modeling and emulation; (3) Simulation-based inference; (4) Causal modeling and inference; (5) Agent-based modeling; (6) Probabilistic programming; (7) Differentiable programming; (8) Open-ended optimization; (9) Machine programming. We believe coordinated efforts between motifs offers immense opportunity to accelerate scientific discovery, from solving inverse problems in synthetic biology and climate science, to directing nuclear energy experiments and predicting emergent behavior in socioeconomic settings. We elaborate on each layer of the SI-stack, detailing the state-of-art methods, presenting examples to highlight challenges and opportunities, and advocating for specific ways to advance the motifs and the synergies from their combinations. Advancing and integrating these technologies can enable a robust and efficient hypothesis-simulation-analysis type of scientific method, which we introduce with several use-cases for human-machine teaming and automated science.},

We train a "graph neural network" to simulate the dynamics of our solar system's Sun, planets, and large moons from 30 years of trajectory data. We then use symbolic regression to discover an analytical expression for the force law implicitly learned by the neural network, which our results showed is equivalent to Newton's law of gravitation. The key assumptions that were required were translational and rotational equivariance, and Newton's second and third laws of motion. Our approach correctly discovered the form of the symbolic force law. Furthermore, our approach did not require any assumptions about the masses of planets and moons or physical constants. They, too, were accurately inferred through our methods. Though, of course, the classical law of gravitation has been known since Isaac Newton, our result serves as a validation that our method can discover unknown laws and hidden properties from observed data.

Fluids are well described by the Navier–Stokes equations, but solving these equations at scale remains daunting, limited by the computational cost of resolving the smallest spatiotemporal features. This leads to unfavorable trade-offs between accuracy and tractability. Here we use end-to-end deep learning to improve approximations inside computational fluid dynamics for modeling two-dimensional turbulent flows. For both direct numerical simulation of turbulence and large-eddy simulation, our results are as accurate as baseline solvers with 8 to 10× finer resolution in each spatial dimension, resulting in 40- to 80-fold computational speedups. Our method remains stable during long simulations and generalizes to forcing functions and Reynolds numbers outside of the flows where it is trained, in contrast to black-box machine-learning approaches. Our approach exemplifies how scientific computing can leverage machine learning and hardware accelerators to improve simulations without sacrificing accuracy or generalization.},

These cold spells were linked to a meandering upper-tropospheric jet stream pattern and a negative Arctic Oscillation index (AO). However, the nature of the drivers behind these circulation patterns remains controversial. Various studies have proposed different mechanisms related to changes in the Arctic, most of them related to a reduction in sea ice concentrations or increasing Eurasian snow cover.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Here, a novel type of time series analysis, called causal effect networks (CEN), based on graphical models is introduced to assess causal relationships and their time delays between different processes. The effect of different Arctic actors on winter circulation on weekly to monthly time scales is studied, and robust network patterns are found. Barents and Kara sea ice concentrations are detected to be important external drivers of the midlatitude circulation, influencing winter AO via tropospheric mechanisms and through processes involving the stratosphere. Eurasia snow cover is also detected to have a causal effect on sea level pressure in Asia, but its exact role on AO remains unclear. The CEN approach presented in this study overcomes some difficulties in interpreting correlation analyses, complements model experiments for testing hypotheses involving teleconnections, and can be used to assess their validity. The findings confirm that sea ice concentrations in autumn in the Barents and Kara Seas are an important driver of winter circulation in the midlatitudes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

  abstract  = {Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort1–4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’8—has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years9. Despite recent progress10–14, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

Here, we focus on parameterizations of ocean mesoscale eddies and employ machine learning (ML), namely, relevance vector machines (RVMs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to derive computationally efficient parameterizations from data, which are interpretable and/or encapsulate physics. In particular, we demonstrate the usefulness of the RVM algorithm to reveal closed-form equations for eddy parameterizations with embedded conservation laws. When implemented in an idealized ocean model, all parameterizations improve the statistics of the coarse-resolution simulation. The CNN is more stable than the RVM such that its skill in reproducing the high-resolution simulation is higher than the other schemes; however, the RVM scheme is interpretable. This work shows the potential for new physics-aware interpretable ML turbulence parameterizations for use in ocean climate models.},

  abstract   = {Extracting actionable insight from complex unlabeled scientiﬁc data is an open challenge and key to unlocking data-driven discovery in science. Complementary and alternative to supervised machine learning approaches, unsupervised physics-based methods based on behavior-driven theories hold great promise. Due to computational limitations, practical application on real-world domain science problems has lagged far behind theoretical development. However, powerful modern supercomputers provide the opportunity to narrow the gap between theory and practical application. We present our ﬁrst step towards bridging this divide - DisCo - a high-performance distributed workﬂow for the behavior-driven local causal state theory. DisCo provides a scalable unsupervised physics-based representation learning method that decomposes spatiotemporal systems into their structurally relevant components, which are captured by the latent local causal state variables. Complex spatiotemporal systems are generally highly structured and organize around a lower-dimensional skeleton of coherent structures, and in several ﬁrsts we demonstrate the efﬁcacy of DisCo in capturing such structures from observational and simulated scientiﬁc data. To the best of our knowledge, DisCo is also the ﬁrst application software developed entirely in Python to scale to over 1000 machine nodes, providing good performance along with ensuring domain scientists’ productivity. We developed scalable, performant methods optimized for Intel many-core processors that will be upstreamed to open-source Python library packages. Our capstone experiment, using newly developed DisCo workﬂow and libraries, performs unsupervised spacetime segmentation analysis of CAM5.1 climate simulation data, processing an unprecedented 89.5 TB in 6.6 minutes end-to-end using 1024 Intel Haswell nodes on the Cori supercomputer obtaining 91\% weak-scaling and 64\% strong-scaling efﬁciency. This enables us to achieve state-of-the-art unsupervised segmentation of coherent spatiotemporal structures in complex ﬂuid ﬂows.},

  abstract   = {Partial differential equations (PDEs) are commonly derived based on empirical observations. However, recent advances of technology enable us to collect and store massive amount of data, which offers new opportunities for data-driven discovery of PDEs. In this paper, we propose a new deep neural network, called PDE-Net 2.0, to discover (time-dependent) PDEs from observed dynamic data with minor prior knowledge on the underlying mechanism that drives the dynamics. The design of PDE-Net 2.0 is based on our earlier work {\textbackslash}cite\{Long2018PDE\} where the original version of PDE-Net was proposed. PDE-Net 2.0 is a combination of numerical approximation of differential operators by convolutions and a symbolic multi-layer neural network for model recovery. Comparing with existing approaches, PDE-Net 2.0 has the most flexibility and expressive power by learning both differential operators and the nonlinear response function of the underlying PDE model. Numerical experiments show that the PDE-Net 2.0 has the potential to uncover the hidden PDE of the observed dynamics, and predict the dynamical behavior for a relatively long time, even in a noisy environment.},

  abstract = {The conjoining of dynamical systems and deep learning has become a topic of great interest. In particular, neural differential equations (NDEs) demonstrate that neural networks and differential equation are two sides of the same coin. Traditional parameterised differential equations are a special case. Many popular neural network architectures, such as residual networks and recurrent networks, are discretisations. NDEs are suitable for tackling generative problems, dynamical systems, and time series (particularly in physics, finance, ...) and are thus of interest to both modern machine learning and traditional mathematical modelling. NDEs offer high-capacity function approximation, strong priors on model space, the ability to handle irregular data, memory efficiency, and a wealth of available theory on both sides. This doctoral thesis provides an in-depth survey of the field. Topics include: neural ordinary differential equations (e.g. for hybrid neural/mechanistic modelling of physical systems); neural controlled differential equations (e.g. for learning functions of irregular time series); and neural stochastic differential equations (e.g. to produce generative models capable of representing complex stochastic dynamics, or sampling from complex high-dimensional distributions). Further topics include: numerical methods for NDEs (e.g. reversible differential equations solvers, backpropagation through differential equations, Brownian reconstruction); symbolic regression for dynamical systems (e.g. via regularised evolution); and deep implicit models (e.g. deep equilibrium models, differentiable optimisation). We anticipate this thesis will be of interest to anyone interested in the marriage of deep learning with dynamical systems, and hope it will provide a useful reference for the current state of the art.},

  abstract = {Extreme surface waves occur in the tail of the probability distribution. Their occurrence rate can be displayed effectively by plotting ln(−lnP ), where P is the probability of the wave or crest height exceeding a particular value, against the logarithm of that value. A Weibull distribution of the exceedance probability, as proposed in a standard model, then becomes a straight line. Earlier North Sea data from an oil platform suggest a curved plot, with a higher occurrence rate of extreme wave and crest heights than predicted by the standard model. The curvature is not accounted for by second order corrections, non-stationarity, or Benjamin-Feir instability, though all of these do lead to an increase in the exceedance probability. Simulations for deep water waves suggest that, if the waves are steep, the curvature may be explained by including up to fourth order Stokes corrections. Finally, the use of extreme value theory in ﬁtting exceedance probabilities is shown to be inappropriate, as its application requires that not just N, but also lnN, be large, where N is the number of waves in a data block. This is unlikely to be adequately satisﬁed.},

However, the importance of this instability in the context of ocean waves is not well established. This mechanism has been successfully studied in laboratory experiments and in mathematical studies, but there is no consensus on what actually takes place in the ocean. In this work, we question the oceanic relevance of this paradigm. In particular, we analyze several sets of field data in various European locations with various tools, and find that the main generation mechanism for rogue waves is the constructive interference of elementary waves enhanced by second-order bound nonlinearities and not the modulational instability. This implies that rogue waves are likely to be rare occurrences of weakly nonlinear random seas.},

Surface elevations were measured with a 5-beam acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) at relatively shallow waters off the west coast of Ireland. To compensate for the significant variability of both sea states in time, we consider a novel approach for analyzing the non-stationary surface-elevation series and compare the distributions of crest and wave heights observed with theoretical predictions based on the Forristall, Tayfun and Boccotti models. In particular, the latter two models have been largely applied to and validated for deep-water waves. We show here that they also describe well the characteristics of waves observed in relatively shallow waters. The largest nearshore waves observed during the two storms do not exceed the rogue thresholds as the Draupner, Andrea, Killard or El Faro rogue waves do in intermediate or deep-water depths. Nevertheless, our analysis reveals that modulational instabilities are ineffective, third-order resonances negligible and the largest waves observed here have characteristics quite similar to those displayed by rogue waves for which second order bound nonlinearities are the principal factor that enhances the linear dispersive focusing of extreme waves.},

  abstract = {The theory of long waves in shallow water under gravity employs two different approaches, which have given rise to a well-known paradox remarked by Stokes, but hitherto not fully resolved. On the one hand it was shown by Airy (1) that, if the pressure at any point in the fluid is equal to the hydrostatic head due to the column of water above it, then no wave form can be propagated without change hi shallow water of uniform depth; on the other hand, it was shown by Rayleigh's theory (8) of the solitary wave that this conclusion may be incorrect. In the present paper an attempt is made to elucidate the paradox. Waves of small amplitude η0 and large horizontal wave-length λ (compared with the depth h of the water) are studied, and it is shown that Airy's conclusion is valid if η0λ2/h3 ia large, whereas the solitary wave has η0λ2/h3 of order unity. Equations of motion are derived corresponding to large, moderate and small values of η0λ2/h3; these can be summarized in a single equation for the profile η(x, t): due to Boussinesq (3).It is also shown that the linearized theory of surface waves is valid only if η0/λ and η0λ2/h3 are both small. Some remarks are made on the generation of the solitary wave, and on the breaking of waves on a shelving beach.},

  abstract = {The conventional definition of rogue waves in the ocean is that their heights, from crest to trough, are more than about twice the significant wave height, which is the average wave height of the largest one-third of nearby waves. When modeling deep water waves using the nonlinear Schrödinger equation, the most likely candidate satisfying this criterion is the so-called Peregrine solution. It is localized in both space and time, thus describing a unique wave event. Until now, experiments specifically designed for observation of breather states in the evolution of deep water waves have never been made in this double limit. In the present work, we present the first experimental results with observations of the Peregrine soliton in a water wave tank.},

  abstract = {A review of physical mechanisms of the rogue wave phenomenon is given. The data of marine observations as well as laboratory experiments are briefly discussed. They demonstrate that freak waves may appear in deep and shallow waters. Simple statistical analysis of the rogue wave probability based on the assumption of a Gaussian wave field is reproduced. In the context of water wave theories the probabilistic approach shows that numerical simulations of freak waves should be made for very long times on large spatial domains and large number of realizations. As linear models of freak waves the following mechanisms are considered: dispersion enhancement of transient wave groups, geometrical focusing in basins of variable depth, and wave-current interaction. Taking into account nonlinearity of the water waves, these mechanisms remain valid but should be modified. Also, the influence of the nonlinear modulational instability (Benjamin–Feir instability) on the rogue wave occurence is discussed. Specific numerical simulations were performed in the framework of classical nonlinear evolution equations: the nonlinear Schrödinger equation, the Davey–Stewartson system, the Korteweg–de Vries equation, the Kadomtsev–Petviashvili equation, the Zakharov equation, and the fully nonlinear potential equations. Their results show the main features of the physical mechanisms of rogue wave phenomenon.},

We study numerically the long time evolution of a surface gravity wave packet, comparing a fully nonlinear model with Schrödinger-like simplified equations. We observe that the interaction between envelope solitons generates large waves. This is predicted by both models. The fully nonlinear simulations show a qualitative behaviour that differs significantly from the ones preticted by Schrödinger models, however. Indeed, the occurence of freak waves is much more frequent with the fully nonlinear model. This is a consequence of the long-time interaction between envelope solitons, which, in the fully nonlinear model, is totally different from the Schrödinger scenario. The fundamental differences appear for times when the simplified equations cease to be valid. Possible statistical models, based on the latter, should hence under-estimate the probability of freak wave formation. To cite this article: D. Clamond, J. Grue, C. R. Mecanique 330 (2002) 575–580.

                On s'interresse à un mécanisme particulier pouvant expliquer l'apparition de vagues de grandes amplitudes (freak waves). On étudie numériquement l'évolution à long terme de paquets d'onde de gravité surfaciques. On compare un modèle complètement non linéaire avec des équations simplifiées de type Schrödinger. On observe que l'interaction d'ondes solitaires enveloppes génèrent des vagues de grandes amplitudes. Cela est prédit par tous les modèles. Toutefois, le modèle complètement non linéaire exhibe un comportement à long terme très different des modèles simplifiés. L'apparition de freak waves y est beaucoup plus fréquente. C'est une conséquence de l'interaction à long terme de solitons enveloppes, qui est totalement différente de celle prédite par les scénario dérivés des équations de type Schrödinger. Les différences fondamentales apparaissent pour des temps supérieurs aux domaı̂nes de validité des équations simplifiées. D'envisageable modèles statistiques, basés sur ces dernières, devraient donc sous-estimer la probabilité d'apparition de freak waves. Pour citer cet article : D. Clamond, J. Grue, C. R.

Here, mechanically generated waves in a three-dimensional basin and numerical simulations of nonlinear waves have been compared in order to assess the ability of numerical models to describe the evolution of weakly nonlinear waves and predict the probability of occurrence of extreme waves within a variety of random directional wave fields. Numerical simulations have been performed following two different approaches: numerical integration of a modified nonlinear Schrödinger equation and numerical integration of the potential Euler equations based on a higher-order spectral method. Whereas the first makes a narrow-banded approximation (both in frequency and direction), the latter is free from bandwidth constraints. Both models assume weakly nonlinear waves. On the whole, it has been found that the statistical properties of numerically simulated wave fields are in good quantitative agreement with laboratory observations. Moreover, this study shows that the modified nonlinear Schrödinger equation can also provide consistent results outside its narrow-banded domain of validity.},

As shown here, these hydrodynamic instantons are complex spatiotemporal wave field configurations which can be defined using the mathematical framework of large deviation theory and calculated via tailored numerical methods. These results indicate that the instantons describe equally well rogue waves created by simple linear superposition (in weakly nonlinear conditions) or by nonlinear focusing (in strongly nonlinear conditions), paving the way for the development of a unified explanation to rogue wave formation.},

  abstract = {In this essay we give an overview on the problem of rogue or freak wave formation in the ocean. The matter of the phenomenon is a sporadic occurrence of unexpectedly high waves on the sea surface. These waves cause serious danger for sailing and sea use. A number of huge wave accidents, resulting in damages, ship losses and people injuries and deaths, are known. Now marine researchers do believe that these waves belong to a specific kind of sea wave, not taken into account by conventional models for sea wind waves. This paper addresses the nature of the rogue wave problem from a general viewpoint based on wave process ideas. We start by introducing some primitive elements of sea wave physics with the purpose of paving the way for further discussion. We discuss linear physical mechanisms which are responsible for high wave formation, at first. Then, we proceed with a description of different sea conditions, starting from the open deep sea, and approaching the sea coast. Nonlinear effects which are able to cause rogue waves are emphasised. In conclusion we briefly discuss the generality of the physical mechanisms suggested for the rogue wave explanation; they are valid for rogue wave phenomena in other media such as solid matters, superconductors, plasmas and nonlinear optics.},

The stability of an initially homogeneous wave spectrum, to small oblique wave perturbations is studied for a range of spectral bandwidths, resulting in an integral equation for the amplification rate of the disturbance. It is shown for random deep water waves that instability of the wavetrain can exist, as in the corresponding deterministic Benjamin-Feir (B-F) problem, provided that the normalized spectral bandwidth σ/k0 is less than twice the root mean square wave slope, multiplied by a function of the perturbation wave angle ϕ = arctan (m/l). A further condition for instability is that the angle ϕ be less than 35.26°. It is demonstrated that the amplification rate, associated with the B-F type instability, diminishes and then vanishes as the correlation length scale of the random wave field (ca. 1/σ)is reduced to the order of the characteristic length scale for modulational instability of the wave system.},

  abstract = {The phenomenon in question arises when a periodic progressive wave train with fundamental frequency ω is formed on deep water—say by radiation from an oscillating paddle—and there are also present residual wave motions at adjacent side-band frequencies ω(1 ± δ), such as would be generated if the movement of the paddle suffered a slight modulation at low frequency. In consequence of coupling through the non-linear boundary conditions at the free surface, energy is then transferred from the primary motion to the side bands at a rate that, as will be shown herein, can increase exponentially as the interaction proceeds. The result is that the wave train becomes highly irregular far from its origin, even when the departures from periodicity are scarcely detectable at the start.In this paper a theoretical investigation is made into the stability of periodic wave trains to small disturbances in the form of a pair of side-band modes, and Part 2 which will follow is an account of some experimental observations in accord with the present predictions. The main conclusion of the theory is that infinitesimal disturbances of the type considered will undergo unbounded magnification if

The computation of this index requires the estimation of a number of parameters such as the spectral bandwidth and the peak frequency. For a given time series or a wave spectrum those parameters can be calculated using different methods, thus leading to different numerical values of the BFI.

A number of ases in which these equations reduce to a one dimensional nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) equation are enumerated.Several analytical solutions of NLS equations are presented, with discussion of some of their implications for describing the propagation of water waves. Some of the solutions have not been presented in detail, or in convenient form before. One is new, a “rational” solution describing an “amplitude peak” which is isolated in space-time. Ma's [13] soli ton is particularly relevant to the recurrence of uniform wave trains in the experiment of Lake et al.[10].In further discussion it is pointed out that although water waves are unstable to three-dimensional disturbances, an effective description of weakly nonlinear two-dimensional waves would be a useful step towards describing ocean wave propagation.},

  abstract = {We study the occurrence and dynamics of rogue waves in three-dimensional deep water using phase-resolved numerical simulations based on a high-order spectral (HOS) method. We obtain a large ensemble of nonlinear wave-field simulations ( in HOS method), initialized by spectral parameters over a broad range, from which nonlinear wave statistics and rogue wave occurrence are investigated. The HOS results are compared to those from the broad-band modified nonlinear Schrödinger (BMNLS) equations. Our results show that for (initially) narrow-band and narrow directional spreading wave fields, modulational instability develops, resulting in non-Gaussian statistics and a probability of rogue wave occurrence that is an order of magnitude higher than linear theory prediction. For longer times, the evolution becomes quasi-stationary with non-Gaussian statistics, a result not predicted by the BMNLS equations (without consideration of dissipation). When waves spread broadly in frequency and direction, the modulational instability effect is reduced, and the statistics and rogue wave probability are qualitatively similar to those from linear theory. To account for the effects of directional spreading on modulational instability, we propose a new modified Benjamin–Feir index for effectively predicting rogue wave occurrence in directional seas. For short-crested seas, the probability of rogue waves based on number frequency is imprecise and problematic. We introduce an area-based probability, which is well defined and convergent for all directional spreading. Based on a large catalogue of simulated rogue wave events, we analyse their geometry using proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). We find that rogue wave profiles containing a single wave can generally be described by a small number of POD modes.},

  abstract = {A possible physical mechanism for the formation of freak waves on the open ocean is the localized interactions between wind and waves. Such interactions are highly complex and are currently poorly understood at the scale of an individual wave. Rather than attempt to model the detailed transfer of energy from wind to waves, we simply consider the modifications to wave group dynamics of adding energy to the system. We carried out numerical experiments on isolated wave groups using an excited version of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation. Energy input enhances any soliton-like structures relative to regular waves for unidirectional propagation. For directionally spread wave groups, energy input enhances the nonlinear changes to the shapes of focused wave groups: Groups contract in the mean wave direction and expand in the lateral direction to a significantly greater degree than observed for non-excited wave groups.There is substantial evidence that large waves on the open ocean occur more frequently than predicted by standard theory. See for instance Stansell (2004), Lawton (2001), Liu (2007) and reviews by Kharif and Pelinovsky (2003) and Dysthe et al. (2008). In unidirectional seas these large waves may be accounted for by nonlinear wave-wave interactions (Baldock et al., 1996; Janssen, 2003; Onorato et al., 2006; Adcock and Taylor, 2009). However, directional spreading greatly reduces these interactions (Onorato et al., 2009; Waseda et al., 2009). Studies in directionally spread seas (Gibbs and Taylor, 2005; Socquet-Juglard et al., 2005; Gramstad and Trulsen, 2007) find little extra elevation over that expected in 2nd-order theory. Real ocean waves are directionally spread (Forristall and Ewans, 1998), so there remains an open question as to why so-called freak waves occur in sea states with typical rms directional spreading between 10° and 30°. One possible mechanism for rogue wave development is through localised wind-wave interaction.},

  abstract  = {Despite great progress in simulating multiphysics problems using the numerical discretization of partial differential equations (PDEs), one still cannot seamlessly incorporate noisy data into existing algorithms, mesh generation remains complex, and high-dimensional problems governed by parameterized PDEs cannot be tackled. Moreover, solving inverse problems with hidden physics is often prohibitively expensive and requires different formulations and elaborate computer codes. Machine learning has emerged as a promising alternative, but training deep neural networks requires big data, not always available for scientific problems. Instead, such networks can be trained from additional information obtained by enforcing the physical laws (for example, at random points in the continuous space-time domain). Such physics-informed learning integrates (noisy) data and mathematical models, and implements them through neural networks or other kernel-based regression networks. Moreover, it may be possible to design specialized network architectures that automatically satisfy some of the physical invariants for better accuracy, faster training and improved generalization. Here, we review some of the prevailing trends in embedding physics into machine learning, present some of the current capabilities and limitations and discuss diverse applications of physics-informed learning both for forward and inverse problems, including discovering hidden physics and tackling high-dimensional problems.},

  abstract = {We present a “physics-enhanced deep-surrogate” (“PEDS”) approach towards developing fast surrogate models for complex physical systems described by partial differential equations (PDEs) and similar models: we show how to combine a low-ﬁdelity “coarse” solver with a neural network that generates “coarsiﬁed” inputs, trained end-to-end to globally match the output of an expensive high-ﬁdelity numerical solver. In this way, by incorporating limited physical knowledge in the form of the low-ﬁdelity model, we ﬁnd that a PEDS surrogate can be trained with at least ∼ 10× less data than a “black-box” neural network for the same accuracy. Asymptotically, PEDS appears to learn with a steeper power law than black-box surrogates, and beneﬁts even further when combined with active learning. We demonstrate feasibility and beneﬁt of the proposed approach by using an example problem in electromagnetic scattering that appears in the design of optical metamaterials.},

                We argue that the boldest claims of big data (BD) are in need of revision and toning-down, in view of a few basic lessons learned from the science of complex systems. We point out that, once the most extravagant claims of BD are properly discarded, a synergistic merging of BD with big theory offers considerable potential to spawn a new scientific paradigm capable of overcoming some of the major barriers confronted by the modern scientific method originating with Galileo. These obstacles are due to the presence of nonlinearity, non-locality and hyperdimensions which one encounters frequently in multi-scale modelling of complex systems.

  abstract   = {The scientific method has been guiding biological research for a long time. It not only prescribes the order and types of activities that give a scientific study validity and a stamp of approval but also has substantially shaped how we collectively think about the endeavor of investigating nature. The advent of high-throughput data generation, data mining, and advanced computational modeling has thrown the formerly undisputed, monolithic status of the scientific method into turmoil. On the one hand, the new approaches are clearly successful and expect the same acceptance as the traditional methods, but on the other hand, they replace much of the hypothesis-driven reasoning with inductive argumentation, which philosophers of science consider problematic. Intrigued by the enormous wealth of data and the power of machine learning, some scientists have even argued that significant correlations within datasets could make the entire quest for causation obsolete. Many of these issues have been passionately debated during the past two decades, often with scant agreement. It is proffered here that hypothesis-driven, data-mining–inspired, and “allochthonous” knowledge acquisition, based on mathematical and computational models, are vectors spanning a 3D space of an expanded scientific method. The combination of methods within this space will most certainly shape our thinking about nature, with implications for experimental design, peer review and funding, sharing of result, education, medical diagnostics, and even questions of litigation.},

  abstract = {A central challenge in data-driven model discovery is the presence of hidden, or latent, variables that are not directly measured but are dynamically important. Takens' theorem provides conditions for when it is possible to augment these partial measurements with time delayed information, resulting in an attractor that is diffeomorphic to that of the original full-state system. However, the coordinate transformation back to the original attractor is typically unknown, and learning the dynamics in the embedding space has remained an open challenge for decades. Here, we design a custom deep autoencoder network to learn a coordinate transformation from the delay embedded space into a new space where it is possible to represent the dynamics in a sparse, closed form. We demonstrate this approach on the Lorenz, R{\textbackslash}"ossler, and Lotka-Volterra systems, learning dynamics from a single measurement variable. As a challenging example, we learn a Lorenz analogue from a single scalar variable extracted from a video of a chaotic waterwheel experiment. The resulting modeling framework combines deep learning to uncover effective coordinates and the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) for interpretable modeling. Thus, we show that it is possible to simultaneously learn a closed-form model and the associated coordinate system for partially observed dynamics.},

  abstract  = {Extracting governing equations from data is a central challenge in many diverse areas of science and engineering. Data are abundant whereas models often remain elusive, as in climate science, neuroscience, ecology, finance, and epidemiology, to name only a few examples. In this work, we combine sparsity-promoting techniques and machine learning with nonlinear dynamical systems to discover governing equations from noisy measurement data. The only assumption about the structure of the model is that there are only a few important terms that govern the dynamics, so that the equations are sparse in the space of possible functions; this assumption holds for many physical systems in an appropriate basis. In particular, we use sparse regression to determine the fewest terms in the dynamic governing equations required to accurately represent the data. This results in parsimonious models that balance accuracy with model complexity to avoid overfitting. We demonstrate the algorithm on a wide range of problems, from simple canonical systems, including linear and nonlinear oscillators and the chaotic Lorenz system, to the fluid vortex shedding behind an obstacle. The fluid example illustrates the ability of this method to discover the underlying dynamics of a system that took experts in the community nearly 30 years to resolve. We also show that this method generalizes to parameterized systems and systems that are time-varying or have external forcing.},

Advances in sparse regression are currently enabling the tractable identification of both the structure and parameters of a nonlinear dynamical system from data. The resulting models have the fewest terms necessary to describe the dynamics, balancing model complexity with descriptive ability, and thus promoting interpretability and generalizability. This provides an algorithmic approach to Occam’s razor for model discovery. However, this approach fundamentally relies on an effective coordinate system in which the dynamics have a simple representation. In this work, we design a custom deep autoencoder network to discover a coordinate transformation into a reduced space where the dynamics may be sparsely represented. Thus, we simultaneously learn the governing equations and the associated coordinate system. We demonstrate this approach on several example high-dimensional systems with low-dimensional behavior. The resulting modeling framework combines the strengths of deep neural networks for flexible representation and sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) for parsimonious models. This method places the discovery of coordinates and models on an equal footing.},

So far differentiable causal discovery has focused on static datasets of observational or interventional origin. In this work, we introduce an active intervention-targeting mechanism which enables a quick identiﬁcation of the underlying causal structure of the data-generating process. Our method signiﬁcantly reduces the required number of interactions compared with random intervention targeting and is applicable for both discrete and continuous optimization formulations of learning the underlying directed acyclic graph (DAG) from data.

  abstract = {Abstract Rogue waves are ocean surface waves larger than the surrounding sea that can pose a danger to ships and offshore structures. They are often deemed unpredictable without complex measurement of the wavefield and computationally intensive calculation, which is infeasible in most applications; consequently, there a need for fast predictors. Here we collate, quality control, and analyze the largest data set of single-point field measurements from surface following wave buoys to search for predictors of rogue wave occurrence. We find that analysis of the sea state parameters in bulk yields no predictors, as the subset of seas containing rogue waves sits within the set of seas without. However, spectral bandwidth parameters of rogue seas display different probability distributions to normal seas, but these parameters are rarely provided in wave forecasts. When location is accounted for, trends can be identified in the occurrence of rogue waves as a function of the average sea state characteristics at that location. These trends follow a power law relationship with the characteristic sea state parameters: mean significant wave height and mean zero upcrossing wave period. We find that frequency of occurrence of rogue waves and their generating mechanism is not spatially uniform, and each location is likely to have its own unique sensitivities, which increase in the coastal seas. We conclude that forecastable predictors of rogue wave occurrence will need to be location specific and reflective of their generation mechanism. Therefore, given location and a sufficiently long historical record of sea state characteristics, the likelihood of occurrence can be obtained for mariners and offshore operators.},

Here, rogue waves refer to waves whose height exceeds twice the significant wave height. Rogue wave frequencies were analyzed and compared to Rayleigh and Forristall distributions, and spatial, seasonal, and long-term variability was assessed. Rogue wave frequency appeared to be relatively constant over the course of the year and uncorrelated among the different measurement sites. While data from buoys basically correspond with expectations from the Forristall distribution, radar measurement showed some deviations in the upper tail pointing towards higher rogue wave frequencies. The amount of data available in the upper tail is, however, still too limited to allow a robust assessment. Some indications were found that the distribution of waves in samples with and without rogue waves was different in a statistical sense. However, differences were small and deemed not to be relevant as attempts to use them as a criterion for rogue wave detection were not successful in Monte Carlo experiments based on the available data.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

According to Ochi's definition of freak wave, 175 coastal freak waves were obtained from a long-term full scale wave data bank, in which there are more than 4500 wave records. The probability distribution of occurrence of coastal freak waves was investigated. The goodness-of-fit testing shows that the Rayleigh distribution is more appropriate for describing the occurrence probability of coastal freak waves when the ratio of its wave height to the corresponding significant wave height is more than 2.4. However, the occurrence probability of coastal freak waves remains below the Rayleigh distribution. The relationship between coastal freak waves and the related sea states shows that the occurrence possibility of coastal freak waves may significantly increase in the sea of grouping waves or in the wave field of bimodal spectra. Wavelet Transform was applied to the in situ wave records to investigate the energy distribution on the time-frequency domain. It justified the previous conclusions and demonstrated that the wave groups and superposition of the swell and wind wave energy, which occupies 70\% of the coastal freak samples, play major roles of inducing the coastal freak waves.},

The observed normalized trough depths are found to be Rayleigh distributed with near-perfect scaling. The normalized crest heights are also Rayleigh distributed but 3\% higher than given by the conventional Rayleigh distribution. The observed normalized wave heights are not well predicted by the conventional Rayleigh distribution (overprediction by 9.5\% on average), but they are very well predicted by Rayleigh-like distributions obtained from linear theories and by an empirical Weibull distribution (errors {\textless}1.5\%). These linear theories also properly predict the observed monotonic variation of the normalized wave heights with the (de-)correlation between crest height and trough depth. The theoretical Rayleigh-like distributions may therefore be preferred over the empirical Weibull distribution and certainly over the conventional Rayleigh distribution. The values of the observed expected maximum wave height (normalized) as a function of duration are consistent with these findings. To inspect nonlinear effects, the buoy observations were supplemented with 10,000 waves observed with laser altimeters mounted on a fixed platform (0 {\textless} {\textless} 7). The (normalized) crest heights thus observed are typically 5\% higher than those observed with the buoys, whereas the (normalized) trough depths are typically 12\% shallower. The distribution of the normalized wave heights thus observed is practically identical to the distribution observed with the buoys. These findings suggest that crest heights and trough depths are affected by nonlinear effects, but wave heights are not. One wave in our buoy observations may qualify as a freak wave.},

CDIP maintains an array of Datawell™ Waverider directional wave buoys in US and territorial waters. Primary funding is provided by the US Army Corps of Engineers, with additional funding from the State of California, the U.S. Navy, various federal agencies, and the private sector. In recent years, collaborations with NOAA's regional Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS) programs have further expanded the CDIP array, which presently includes stations along the Atlantic and Pacific mainland coasts, plus Alaska, Hawaii, the South Pacific, Lake Superior, the Gulf Coast of Florida, and Puerto Rico. Collecting reliable wave buoy data begins with using high quality instruments and maintaining them properly. Working closely with the buoy manufacturer, CDIP has been expanding and improving pre-and post-deployment sensor validation capabilities. Comprehensive and well-documented quality control measures are then applied to the real-time data. Advanced diagnostics and automated messaging have been developed to provide watch keepers with real time notice of any environmental conditions, vessel interference, or technical malfunctions that invalidate the data. Newly available sensors, providing surface current and air temperature data in addition to the waves and sea surface temperature, have been beta-tested and incorporated. The current data have been applied to better understand mooring response to strong currents and effects on wave data. Lessons have been learned and applied regarding the effects of biofouling and anti-fouling measures. As a result, reliable data continue to be collected that characterize long-term wave and sea surface temperature climate, as well as wave conditions generated by major storm events such as Hurricane Florence in 2018. The growing buoy array and evolution of computing resources prompted CDIP to overhaul its data processing, metadata handling, and web hosting infrastructure in order to improve on usability, scalability, reliability, portability and security. Cloud based services are now utilized, and a variety of technologies such as the THREDDS data server, Django™ Web Framework, Django™ Rest Framework, and Docker® containers have been adopted. These forward-looking upgrades will ensure the robustness of CDIP's data management capabilities, wave model output availability, and web presence for years to come.},

Geographically, the majority of the field measurements were recorded in the North Sea, with supplementary data from the Gulf of Mexico, the South China Sea, and the North West shelf of Australia. The significant wave height ranged from 0.12 to 15.4 m, the peak period ranged from 1 to 24.7 s, the maximum crest height was 18.5 m, and the maximum recorded wave height was 25.5 m. This paper will describe the offshore installations, instrumentation, and the strict quality control procedure employed to ensure a reliable dataset. An examination of sea state parameters, environmental conditions, and local characteristics is performed to gain an insight into the behavior of rogue waves. Evidence is provided to demonstrate that rogue waves are not governed by sea state parameters. Rather, the results are consistent with rogue waves being merely extraordinary and rare events of the normal population caused by dispersive focusing.},

Despite an abundance of studies conducting simulations or wave tank experiments, there is so far no reliable forecast for them. In this study, we use data mining and interpretable machine learning to analyze large amounts of observational data instead (more than 1 billion waves). This reveals how rogue wave occurrence depends on the sea state. We find that traditionally favored parameters such as surface elevation kurtosis, steepness, and Benjamin–Feir index are weak predictors for real-world rogue wave risk. In the studied regime, kurtosis is only informative within a single wave group, and is not useful for forecasting. Instead, crest-trough correlation is the dominating parameter in all studied conditions, water depths, and locations, explaining about a factor of 10 in rogue wave risk variation. For rogue crests, where bandwidth effects are unimportant, we find that skewness, steepness, and Ursell number are the strongest predictors, in line with second-order theory. Our results suggest that linear superposition in bandwidth-limited seas is the main pathway to “everyday” rogue waves, with nonlinear contributions providing a minor correction. This casts some doubt whether the common rogue wave definition as any wave exceeding a certain height threshold is meaningful in practice.},

Here, we propose to exploit this invariance of a prediction under a causal model for causal inference: given different experimental settings (e.g. various interventions) we collect all models that do show invariance in their predictive accuracy across settings and interventions. The causal model will be a member of this set of models with high probability. This approach yields valid confidence intervals for the causal relationships in quite general scenarios. We examine the example of structural equation models in more detail and provide sufficient assumptions under which the set of causal predictors becomes identifiable. We further investigate robustness properties of our approach under model misspecification and discuss possible extensions. The empirical properties are studied for various data sets, including large-scale gene perturbation experiments.},

Here it is shown that even in a Gaussian sea, “unexpected” waves, in the sense of, for example, waves twice as large as any in the preceding 30 periods, occur with sufficient frequency to be of interest and importance. The return period of unexpected waves is quantified as a function of the height multiplier and prior quiescent interval for various spectral shapes, and it is shown how the return period is modified if allowance is made for nonlinear changes in wave shape and/or a buildup of one or more waves prior to the unexpected wave.

  abstract = {Nearly four decades have elapsed since the first efforts to obtain a realistic narrow-banded model for extreme wave crests and heights were made, resulting in a couple dozen different exceeding probability distributions. These models reflect results of numerical simulations and storm records measured off of oil platforms, buoys and more recently satellite data. Nevertheless, no consensus has been achieved in either deterministic or operational approaches. Moreover, a minor issue with the established distributions is that they are not bounded by more than one physical limit while others are not bounded at all. Though the literature is rich in physical bounds for single waves, here we describe physical limits for the ensemble of waves that have not yet been addressed. As previous studies have shown, the exceeding probability distribution does not depend unequivocally on one sea state parameter, thus, this work supplies a combination of sea state parameters that provide guidance on the sea state influence on rogue wave occurrence. Based on specific bounds, we conjecture the dependence of the expected maximum of normalized wave heights (also known as abnormality index) and crests on the aforementioned sea-state parameters instead of the total number of waves in the wave record. Finally, we introduce a new dimensionless parameter that is capable of explaining the uneven distribution of rogue waves in the different storms pointed out by Stansell [74].},

With SWAG, we fit a Gaussian using the SWA solution as the first moment and a low rank plus diagonal covariance also derived from the SGD iterates, forming an approximate posterior distribution over neural network weights; we then sample from this Gaussian distribution to perform Bayesian model averaging. We empirically find that SWAG approximates the shape of the true posterior, in accordance with results describing the stationary distribution of SGD iterates.

  abstract = {The key distinguishing property of a Bayesian approach is marginalization, rather than using a single setting of weights. Bayesian marginalization can particularly improve the accuracy and calibration of modern deep neural networks, which are typically underspecified by the data, and can represent many compelling but different solutions. We show that deep ensembles provide an effective mechanism for approximate Bayesian marginalization, and propose a related approach that further improves the predictive distribution by marginalizing within basins of attraction, without significant overhead. We also investigate the prior over functions implied by a vague distribution over neural network weights, explaining the generalization properties of such models from a probabilistic perspective. From this perspective, we explain results that have been presented as mysterious and distinct to neural network generalization, such as the ability to fit images with random labels, and show that these results can be reproduced with Gaussian processes. Finally, we provide a Bayesian perspective on tempering for calibrating predictive distributions.},

  abstract = {Deep neural networks (NNs) are powerful black box predictors that have recently achieved impressive performance on a wide spectrum of tasks. Quantifying predictive uncertainty in NNs is a challenging and yet unsolved problem. Bayesian NNs, which learn a distribution over weights, are currently the state-of-the-art for estimating predictive uncertainty; however these require significant modifications to the training procedure and are computationally expensive compared to standard (non-Bayesian) NNs. We propose an alternative to Bayesian NNs that is simple to implement, readily parallelizable, requires very little hyperparameter tuning, and yields high quality predictive uncertainty estimates. Through a series of experiments on classification and regression benchmarks, we demonstrate that our method produces well-calibrated uncertainty estimates which are as good or better than approximate Bayesian NNs. To assess robustness to dataset shift, we evaluate the predictive uncertainty on test examples from known and unknown distributions, and show that our method is able to express higher uncertainty on out-of-distribution examples. We demonstrate the scalability of our method by evaluating predictive uncertainty estimates on ImageNet.},

Tree ensemble models (such as XGBoost) are usually recommended for classification and regression problems with tabular data. However, several deep learning models for tabular data have recently been proposed, claiming to outperform XGBoost for some use cases. This paper explores whether these deep models should be a recommended option for tabular data by rigorously comparing the new deep models to XGBoost on various datasets. In addition to systematically comparing their performance, we consider the tuning and computation they require. Our study shows that XGBoost outperforms these deep models across the datasets, including the datasets used in the papers that proposed the deep models. We also demonstrate that XGBoost requires much less tuning. On the positive side, we show that an ensemble of deep models and XGBoost performs better on these datasets than XGBoost alone.},

  abstract   = {One of the core problems of modern statistics is to approximate difficult-to-compute probability densities. This problem is especially important in Bayesian statistics, which frames all inference about unknown quantities as a calculation involving the posterior density. In this paper, we review variational inference (VI), a method from machine learning that approximates probability densities through optimization. VI has been used in many applications and tends to be faster than classical methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. The idea behind VI is to first posit a family of densities and then to find the member of that family which is close to the target. Closeness is measured by Kullback-Leibler divergence. We review the ideas behind mean-field variational inference, discuss the special case of VI applied to exponential family models, present a full example with a Bayesian mixture of Gaussians, and derive a variant that uses stochastic optimization to scale up to massive data. We discuss modern research in VI and highlight important open problems. VI is powerful, but it is not yet well understood. Our hope in writing this paper is to catalyze statistical research on this class of algorithms.},

  abstract = {A probabilistic model describes a system in its observational state. In many situations, however, we are interested in the system's response under interventions. The class of structural causal models provides a language that allows us to model the behaviour under interventions. It can been taken as a starting point to answer a plethora of causal questions, including the identification of causal effects or causal structure learning. In this chapter, we provide a natural and straight-forward extension of this concept to dynamical systems, focusing on continuous time models. In particular, we introduce two types of causal kinetic models that differ in how the randomness enters into the model: it may either be considered as observational noise or as systematic driving noise. In both cases, we define interventions and therefore provide a possible starting point for causal inference. In this sense, the book chapter provides more questions than answers. The focus of the proposed causal kinetic models lies on the dynamics themselves rather than corresponding stationary distributions, for example. We believe that this is beneficial when the aim is to model the full time evolution of the system and data are measured at different time points. Under this focus, it is natural to consider interventions in the differential equations themselves.},

To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully connected layers we employed a recently developed regularization method called "dropout" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry.},

Here we introduce a new approach to computer Go that uses ‘value networks’ to evaluate board positions and ‘policy networks’ to select moves. These deep neural networks are trained by a novel combination of supervised learning from human expert games, and reinforcement learning from games of self-play. Without any lookahead search, the neural networks play Go at the level of state-of-the-art Monte Carlo tree search programs that simulate thousands of random games of self-play. We also introduce a new search algorithm that combines Monte Carlo simulation with value and policy networks. Using this search algorithm, our program AlphaGo achieved a 99.8\% winning rate against other Go programs, and defeated the human European Go champion by 5 games to 0. This is the first time that a computer program has defeated a human professional player in the full-sized game of Go, a feat previously thought to be at least a decade away.},

  abstract  = {E-commerce applications rely heavily on session-based recommendation algorithms to improve the shopping experience of their customers. Recent progress in session-based recommendation algorithms shows great promise. However, translating that promise to real-world outcomes is a challenging task for several reasons, but mostly due to the large number and varying characteristics of the available models. In this paper, we discuss the approach and lessons learned from the process of identifying and deploying a successful session-based recommendation algorithm for a leading e-commerce application in the home-improvement domain. To this end, we initially evaluate fourteen session-based recommendation algorithms in an offline setting using eight different popular evaluation metrics on three datasets. The results indicate that offline evaluation does not provide enough insight to make an informed decision since there is no clear winning method on all metrics. Additionally, we observe that standard offline evaluation metrics fall short for this application. Specifically, they reward an algorithm only when it predicts the exact same item that the user clicked next or eventually purchased. In a practical scenario, however, there are near-identical products which, although they are assigned different identifiers, they should be considered as equally-good recommendations. To overcome these limitations, we perform an additional round of evaluation, where human experts provide both objective and subjective feedback for the recommendations of five algorithms that performed the best in the offline evaluation. We find that the experts’ opinion is oftentimes different from the offline evaluation results. Analysis of the feedback confirms that the performance of all models is significantly higher when we evaluate near-identical product recommendations as relevant. Finally, we run an A/B test with one of the models that performed the best in the human evaluation phase. The treatment model increased conversion rate by 15.6% and revenue per visit by 18.5% when compared with a leading third-party solution. },

  abstract = {Sequential modelling with self-attention has achieved cutting edge performances in natural language processing. With advantages in model flexibility, computation complexity and interpretability, self-attention is gradually becoming a key component in event sequence models. However, like most other sequence models, self-attention does not account for the time span between events and thus captures sequential signals rather than temporal patterns. Without relying on recurrent network structures, self-attention recognizes event orderings via positional encoding. To bridge the gap between modelling time-independent and time-dependent event sequence, we introduce a functional feature map that embeds time span into high-dimensional spaces. By constructing the associated translation-invariant time kernel function, we reveal the functional forms of the feature map under classic functional function analysis results, namely Bochner's Theorem and Mercer's Theorem. We propose several models to learn the functional time representation and the interactions with event representation. These methods are evaluated on real-world datasets under various continuous-time event sequence prediction tasks. The experiments reveal that the proposed methods compare favorably to baseline models while also capturing useful time-event interactions.},
