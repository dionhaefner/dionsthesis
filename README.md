# dionsthesis
A custom LaTeX2e documentclass for typesetting beautiful, modern theses.

Apart from [the actual documentclass `dionsthesis`](https://github.com/dionhaefner/dionsthesis/blob/master/dionsthesis.cls), this repository contains the full sources and a PDF version of both my [PhD](https://github.com/dionhaefner/dionsthesis/blob/master/phd-thesis) and [MSc](https://github.com/dionhaefner/dionsthesis/blob/master/msc-thesis) theses.

My custom documentclass `dionsthesis.cls` is based on `uiothesis` by Eivind Uggedal (a mirror of `uiothesis` is found e.g. [here](https://github.com/dergachev/uggedal-thesis)), and is an extension of the amazing `memoir` documentclass.

Documents created with `dionsthesis` can be compiled with any modern PDFLaTeX compiler.
